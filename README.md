# pubsub

Publisher-subscriber architecture in node using Redis and express.

Pub/Sub works by grouping messages into channels. Publishers send messages to the channel, and subscribers listen for the messages.
Messages sent to the channel are broadcast to all subscribers, allowing them to receive notifications in real-time.
